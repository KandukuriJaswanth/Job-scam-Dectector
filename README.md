# **Job-scam-Dectector**
# A web app using Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, and Regex to detect fake job posts and test regex patterns.

# **Project Summary** 
This web app, built using Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Regex, helps users identify fake job posts and test regex patterns. The primary objective of the Fake Job Post Detector is to assist users in verifying whether a job post is genuine or fraudulent based on the provided company name and address. The system uses Regex patterns to detect suspicious keywords like "Urgent Hiring," "Earn Money," "Work from Home," etc. If any suspicious keywords are found, it flags the job post as potentially fake. Additionally, it provides quick access links to Google, LinkedIn, and Job Portals for manual verification. ðŸš€
